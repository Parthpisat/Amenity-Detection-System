# Amenity-Detection-System
This project involves developing an image-based amenity detection model using Detectron2's Faster R-CNN and MobileNet SSD. The model will automate the identification of amenities such as benches, streetlights, and trash cans in urban environments, enhancing city planning, management, with real-time object detection capabilities.
